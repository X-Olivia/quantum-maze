# Quantum Maze Game

## Welcome!

Welcome to the immense and dangerous Quantum Maze, where nothing never makes sense!

You are a single atom exploring an apparently infinite maze, searching for… something. Maybe treasure at the center, maybe an escape, maybe something more. There’s only one way to find out however, to understand the quantum mechanisms in this world to solve the puzzles and defeat the enemies blocking your way.

Good luck Quantum Explorer!

## Tutorial and Help
Stand on tutorial triggers to learn how to interact with the world. These are the main way to understand the game and should teach you everything you’ll need to know, from controls to mechanics.

(A mysterious yet oddly familiar entity may guide you as well sometimes…)

Also, the Encyclopedia can be accessed at any time by pressing the button below the mini map, giving detail on all gameplay elements.

Refer to the `team12-FinalReport.pdf` file in the repository for all other information, technical and not.

## The HUD
### Energy Bar
The large bar at the top left of the screen shows the player’s remaining energy.

Energy is consumed when attacking or duplicating and can be replenished by standing in light.

You won’t die if you run out of energy, but you’ll be slow and unprotected, so be careful!

### Mini map
This helpful display lets you see further than normal, vital as you explore the endless maze ahead.

### Encyclopedia Button
Press the button just below the mini map to open the Encyclopedia.

This contains information on everything in the game, explaining how it works if you get stuck or want to learn about the real-life physics behind the quantum world!

### Wave Mode Timer
When in wave mode you’ll notice the ominous timer counting down.

This shows how spread out in space you are, that is, how likely you are to be found anywhere when you collapse back into a particle.

So don’t let the timer reach zero, or you won’t ever be found and it’s game over!

## Saving
The game autosaves to a single save file (a .json file) every time a level is completed.

This file keeps track of which levels have been unlocked, which collectables have been found and the best times levels have been completed in.

No personal data is stored and no account/internet connection is required.
