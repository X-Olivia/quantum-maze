## Particle mechanics:

There are some specific abilities that can only be performed whilst in particle mode, like making use of the energy resource. An ability is energy emission - energy is emitted from the player in all directions, allowing the player to power certain electrical inputs, decreasing damage of incoming attacks, and perfect parry – by activating the ability just before the player takes damage, they can nullify all damage, and consume no energy, rewarding the player for their timing. Another is shooting photons, using up energy resources to shoot a projectile that damages enemies, and temporarily powers some electrical inputs.

### 1. Initial Setup

### The player particle is represented as an atom, with energy management as the core gameplay mechanic in particle mode. The player starts in a rest state, with energy consisting of rest mass energy and quantum state energy:

- ### Rest Mass Energy: Represents the intrinsic energy of the atom, acting as the player's base health and is not easily affected by external influences.
    
- ### Quantum State Energy: Related to the electron's energy level. The player can increase quantum state energy by absorbing external energy, which is primarily used for attacks and acceleration.
    

## Energy mechanics:

### In quantum physics, energy transitions are described as discrete quantum leaps, meaning the energy is quantized. The player can gain energy through the following methods:

### 2.1 Energy Sources

- ### Photon Absorption:  
    Different colours of photons provide varying amounts of energy:
    

- ### Persistent Sources:
    

- ### Yellow Light Sources: Provide a continuous supply of energy.
    

- ### Consumable Sources:
    

- ### Red Photons: Low energy but easy to collect, suitable for early stages.
    
- ### Yellow Photons: Medium energy, serving as the primary energy source.
    
- ### Blue Photons: High energy but rare, providing high-energy transitions and used in challenge or reward scenarios.  
    The player can absorb photons by interacting with them, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels and increasing quantum state energy.
    

- ### Environmental Energy Fields:  
    Certain areas in the game (e.g., heat sources, electromagnetic fields) provide ambient energy, simulating thermal fluctuations and electromagnetic excitations, helping the player recover energy in unstable states.
    
- ### Energy Collection Devices:
    

- ### Solar Panels: Convert photon energy into quantum state energy when attacked by player-emitted photons.
    
- ### Energy Prism: Disperses photons of different colours, requiring the player to choose and absorb the correct photons based on their energy needs.
    

### 2.2 Energy Usage

- ### Photon Shooting (Attack):  
    The player can consume quantum state energy to emit gamma photons and attack enemies. Photon shooting induces an energy level transition effect on the target, potentially putting enemies in an unstable state or causing loss of mobility.
    
- ### Accelerated Movement (Energy Consumption):  
    The player can use energy to increase movement speed, simulating high-speed motion of electrons at elevated energy levels.
    

- ### Momentum Conservation Mechanism: Accelerating consumes a large amount of energy and generates heat, requiring careful management in high-energy states. At excessively high speeds, the player may trigger a thermal radiation effect, leading to energy overload. The player must decelerate to return to a stable state.
    
- ### When the player is in an unstable state (e.g., due to high-speed movement or excessive energy absorption), quantum state energy may exhibit small random fluctuations, simulating the effect of quantum fluctuations.
    

- ### Interaction with Devices and Neutral Particles (Puzzle Solving):  
    The player can use photon shooting or energy transfer to activate electrical devices (e.g., buttons, levers, probability detectors). By interacting with neutral particles using energy beams, the player can change the state of neutral particles (e.g., inducing transitions, converting to wave form, altering speed) to solve puzzles.
    

## Wave mechanics:

1. Initial Setup

Players can switch to Wave Mode via a key press. In Wave Mode, there is a time limit; when the countdown ends, the player will automatically switch back to Particle Mode. Over time, the amplitude gradually decreases, causing the wave form to become dimmer, blurrier, and slower, simulating the dispersion effect in quantum mechanics. If the player is disturbed by external factors (e.g., enemy attacks or measurement devices), the wave form will collapse faster.  
In Wave Mode, the player’s quantum state is influenced by the quantum fluctuations. Even without external interference, the quantum state energy may exhibit small random fluctuations, visually represented by slight jittering and irregular dimming of the wave form.

2. Core Gameplay and Mechanics

2.1 Double-Slit Experiment  
In Wave Mode, the player can pass through double-slit barriers, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of quantum physics. (In Particle Mode, the player cannot pass through the slits and must switch to Wave Mode.) After passing through the slits, the player can observe an interference pattern on the screen, showing the probability density distribution of the wave. If enemies or measurement devices are “observing” the player beyond the slits, the wave form will immediately collapse into Particle Mode, forcing the switch back.

2.2 Entanglement Operations  
In Wave Mode, the player can perform entanglement using LCLICK and RCLICK, linking two objects (devices or enemies) into an entangled state.

- Entangled Devices:  
    The player can entangle two devices (e.g., buttons and levers). Activating one device will trigger the other simultaneously, which can be used for puzzles and mechanism control.
    

- Entanglement Collapse Mechanism: If the player repeatedly attempts to entangle the same devices, the entangled state may break, and the devices will no longer be linked, requiring re-entanglement.
    

- Entangled Enemies:  
    The player can link two enemies; attacking one enemy will also deal synchronised damage to the other. If the two enemies are not in the same room, detecting one enemy will reveal the position of the other on the screen, simulating the non-locality effect of quantum entanglement.
    

2.3 Interference Effects  
In Wave Mode, the player’s wave can superpose with other waves in the environment, creating interference effects:

- Constructive Interference (Blue Waves): When the player’s wave overlaps with blue waves, the amplitude increases, extending the duration of the wave form. This follows the concept of coherent superposition in quantum mechanics.
    
- Destructive Interference (Red Waves): When the player’s wave overlaps with red waves, the amplitude decreases, accelerating the decay of the wave form. This simulates destructive interference observed in quantum physics.
