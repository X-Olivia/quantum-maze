Player exists as a possibility. They can consume energy to create another possibility at their current position and use keys to cycle between active possibilities.

Possibilities cannot interact physically with the world.

## Time Limit

You can only exist in wave mode for a set amount of time (independent of energy and health).
As this timer ticks down all possibilities start to 'spread out' in a circle as uncertainty in their positions increases.

On collapse, you reappear somewhere within range of the current possibility (with the correct probability).
If you don't collapse in time all possibilities' positions are 'lost' and you never reappear (death).

## Death
Dying ends your active possibility. Normal death when all possibilities die.

Contact with anti-particles no longer kills you.
Bottomless pits still kill you.
Wave troughs kill you. You must stay in the safe peaks to survive.
